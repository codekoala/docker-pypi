PyPI Server
===========

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/codekoala/pypi.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/codekoala/pypi "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

This is a simple PyPI server that can be used to host internal packages and
versions of packages that are suitable for use with proprietary products.

Usage
-----

If you're not dealing with the Git repo but running the container directly from
the Docker index, you can use commands such as the following:

    sudo mkdir -p /srv/pypi             # local directory where packages reside
    sudo touch /srv/pypi/.htpasswd      # credentials file for adding packages
    docker run -t -i --rm \             # remove container when stopped
        -h pypi.local \                 # hostname
        -v /srv/pypi:/srv/pypi:rw \     # host packages from local directory
        -p 8080:80 \                    # expose port 80 as port 8080
        --name pypi \                   # container name
        codekoala/pypi                  # docker repository

Once running, you should be able to visit http://localhost:8080 to see the
landing page for your very own PyPI server.

You can add Python packages to the server simply by including the tarballs,
zips, wheels, eggs, etc in your `/srv/pypi` directory.

Configuration
-------------

There are some environment variables that may be set to override the default
behavior:

* ``PYPI_ROOT``: path within the container where packages will be stored.
  Defaults to ``/srv/pypi``.
* ``PYPI_PORT``: port to bind to receive requests. Defaults to ``80``.
* ``PYPI_PASSWD_FILE``: path to authentication file. Defaults to
  ``/srv/pypi/.htpasswd``.
* ``PYPI_OVERWRITE``: allow existing packages to be overwritten. Defaults to
  ``false``.
* ``PYPI_AUTHENTICATE``: list of (case-insensitive) actions to authenticate.
  Default to `update`.
* ``PYPI_EXTRA``: any additional keyword arguments to ``pypiserver.app``.

Building Your Own
-----------------

You can build a new, up-to-date version of the container by cloning the Git
repository and using the following command:

    make build

This will create a new container that just has the latest version of
`pypiserver` installed and ready to serve packages out of `/srv/pypi`. To use
this container, run:

    make run

This will spin up the `pypi-server` command within container, and it will be
exposed on port `8080` on your host system. To test that the container is
working, visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

Adding Internal Packages
------------------------

Internal packages may be uploaded to this PyPI server quite easily. The first
step is to create a user account:

    htpasswd -s /srv/pypi/.htpasswd yourusername

> You will probably need to re-run `make run` each time you update the
htaccess file, as it will copy the password file to the correct location
before launching the server.

> Alternatively, you might be able to just copy the `htpasswd` file to
`/srv/pypi/.htpasswd` after each change without restarting your PyPI
container.

This command (included with Apache on most distributions) will prompt you for a
password for `yourusername`. You should use a more appropriate username, and
enter a password that you want to use to "secure" your PyPI uploads. Then edit
your `~/.pypirc` (create it if necessary), replacing both `yourusername` and
`yourpassword` with the values used with the `htpasswd` command:

    [distutils]
    index-servers =
        pypi
        internal

    [pypi]
    username:pypiusername
    password:pypipassword

    [internal]
    repository: http://localhost:8080
    username:yourusername
    password:yourpassword

Next, you should be able to go into any Python project with a valid
`setup.py` file and run:

    python setup.py sdist upload -r internal

Assuming the container is online and your credentials are correct, this should
add a package with the project contents to the internal PyPI server.

Adding Third Party Packages
---------------------------

Third party packages can be mirrored on the PyPI server by using a command such
as:

    pip install -d /srv/pypi pkgname

If you have a requirements file for a project's dependencies, you can easily
mirror all dependencies by running:

    pip install -d /srv/pypi -r requirements.txt

Be careful to use the correct version of `pip`--sometimes you might want to run
`pip2` and other times `pip3`.

Updating Mirrored Packages
--------------------------

You can update the packages mirrored on the internal PyPI server by running:

    pypi-server -U /srv/pypi

Each package in the repo will be checked for updates, and instructions for
updating the repo with the latest packages will be displayed.
